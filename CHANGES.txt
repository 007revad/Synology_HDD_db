v1.1.15
- Added support for M.2 drives on a PCI card (M2Dxx and E10G18-T1 and future models).
- Improved flags/options checking and added usage help (-h or --help) and version info (-v or --version).
- Can now download the latest script version for you (if you have 'user home service' enabled in DSM).
- Now adds 'support_m2_pool="yes"' line for models that don't have support_m2_pool in synoinfo.conf
  - To (hopefully) prevent losing your SSH created M2 volume when running this script on models that DSM 7.2 Beta does not list as supported for creating M2 volumes.
- Changed Synology NAS model detection to be more reliable (for models that came in different variations and report extra text after model). issue #2 and issue #10
- Changed checking drive_db_test_url setting to be more durable.
- Fixed bug where removable drives were being added to the drive database.
- Fixed bug where "M.2 volume support already enabled" message appeared when NAS had no M.2 drives.

v1.1.11
- Added support for M.2 SATA drives.
- Can now skip processing M.2 drives by running script with the -m2 flag.
- Changed method of getting drive and firmware version so script is faster and easier to maintain. No longer using smartctl or hdparm.
- Changed SAS drive firmware version detection to support SAS drives that hdparm doesn't work with.
- Removed error message and aborting if *.db.new not found (clean DSM installs don't have a *.db.new).
- Fixed script version check introduced in 1.0.7.

Improved formatting when listing found drives.

v1.0.1
