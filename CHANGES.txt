v1.1.12
- Added check that M.2 volume support is enabled.

v1.1.11
- Added support for M.2 SATA drives.
- Can now skip processing M.2 drives by running script with the -m2 flag.
- Changed method of getting drive and firmware version so script is faster and easier to maintain. No longer using smartctl or hdparm.
- Changed SAS drive firmware version detection to support SAS drives that hdparm doesn't work with.
- Removed error message and aborting if *.db.new not found (clean DSM installs don't have a *.db.new).
- Fixed script version check introduced in 1.0.7.

v1.1.10
- Now makes DSM recheck disk compatibility so reboot not needed (DSM 7 only).
- Fixed DSM 6 bug when DSM 6 used the old db file format.

v1.1.9
- Added support for SAS drives.
- Now gets HDD/SSD/SAS drive model number with smartctl instead of hdparm.

v1.1.8
- Now prevents DSM auto updating the drive database.
- Disable "support_disk_compatibility" (that was added in v1.0.6) is now optional.
  - Run script with -f or -force to disable "support_disk_compatibility".
  - If run without -f or -force "support_disk_compatibility" is re-enabled.

v1.0.7
Added message if newer script version is available.

v1.0.6
Added 2nd method of disabling disk compatibility to solve issue #1 and #4 for the few people where the original method didn't work.

v1.0.5
Changed to avoid issue #2

v1.0.4
Now backs up the database file if there is no backup already.

v1.0.3
Changed to avoid avoid error messages from previous change to search for sda and sata# drives in DSM 6 and DSM 7.
- /dev/sata*: No such file or directory
- /dev/sd*: No such file or directory

v1.0.2
Improved formatting when listing found drives.

v1.0.1
Fixed issue where drives weren't detected if:
- NAS had been updated from DSM 6 to DSM 7 and still used sda, sdb etc.
- Models like the DVA3219 that use sata# even in DSM 6.

v1.0.0
Initial release.
